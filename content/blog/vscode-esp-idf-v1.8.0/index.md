## Introduction

[ESP-IDF Visual Studio Code Extension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension) v1.8.0 has been released! It introduces new features and many improvements. If you face any issue or improvement ideas please share them as a [Github issue](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/issues).

Key features;

- **Eclipse CDT GDB Debug Adapter**

- **ESP-IDF version switcher**

- **Code Navigation without full project build**

- **ESP-IDF Hints viewer**

For other updates please review [v1.8.0 Release notes](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/releases/tag/v1.8.0).

## Eclipse CDT GDB Debug Adapter

First, we will briefly talk about the implementation of debug adapters in VS Code and then will move on to the actual Eclipse CDT Debug Adapter.

### What is a debug adapter in Visual Studio Code ?

VS Code implements a generic (language-agnostic) _Debugger UI_ that is based on an abstract protocol. That protocol was specifically introduced to communicate with debugger backends. As debuggers typically use their own long-established protocols, some "adapter" is needed to allow debugger UI to communicate with debugger backends.

This adapter is typically a standalone process with its own protocol. Both the Debug Adapter (DA) and the abstract protocol that is used between the VS Code's Debugger UI and DA -- the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) -- have already been implemented by independent contributors. The diagram below illustrates it better:

### The actual Eclipse CDT GDB Debug Adapter

Before we have implemented our own [ESP-IDF Debug Adapter](https://github.com/espressif/esp-debug-adapter) in Python. While this debug adapter works, our users have report many issues regarding configuration, responsiveness and runtime errors. In our search for solution we encountered that the Eclipse CDT Cloud team have published a [CDT-GDB-Adapter](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/cdt-gdb-adapter) which is written in TypeScript and is using [NPM serialport package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) underneath. We added a few changes in order to make it work with our tools but it is mostly the same as the original.

To use the Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter in an ESP-IDF project, add the following configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```JSON
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "gdbtarget",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter"
    }
  ]
}
```

To start debugging the project, do the following:
* Build (command palette: **ESP-IDF: Build your Project**)
* Flash (command palette: **ESP-IDF: Flash your Project**)
* In the `Run` menu, press `Start debugging`.

You can also check how to use the new debugger by following the [debug tutorial](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/debugging.md).

The following figure shows an active debug session with the Eclipse CDT GDB Adapter in Visual Studio Code. You can see the list of variables, call stack, breakpoints, debug console and debug controls such as step in, step out, etc.

## Advanced configuration of Eclipse CDT Debug Adapter

There are many configurable options to customize the debug adapter if desired. You can view a deeper description in the [debugging documentation](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/DEBUGGING.md).

## ESP-IDF version switcher

Whenever you install ESP-IDF in your system using the command `ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF Extension`, the installations are saved in our extension as global state IDF setup. Now you can use `ESP-IDF: Select Current ESP-IDF Version` to set the ESP-IDF version you want to use in your current project (_workspace_ folder in VS Code terminology). If you want to delete these IDF setups from the extension global state, you can use `ESP-IDF: Clear Saved ESP-IDF Setups`.

The current ESP-IDF version for currently open ESP-IDF project is shown in the status bar items like this:

## Code navigation without full project build

Now you can generate a `compile_commands.json` file for code navigation extensions without fully building your project by using the command `ESP-IDF: idf.py reconfigure task`. Read on for more explanations.

One of the key features of an IDE is code navigation. While working on your project, you usually want to benefit from such common language features as syntax highlight, code completion, go to definition/declaration, and others. For C/C++ language support, usually the extensions like [C/C++ extension][c-extension] or [clangd extension][clangd-extension] are used.

Such extensions usually rely on a `compile_commands.json` file -- a JSON compilation database which consist of an array of *command objects*, where each command object specifies one way in which a translation unit is compiled in the project. More information about a JSON compilation database can be found [here][code-compilation-database].

If, for any reason, you donâ€™t want to fully build your project but still want to use code navigation, you can use the command `ESP-IDF: idf.py reconfigure task` to generate a `compile_commands.json` file for the language extension to work properly. This command executes the ESP-IDF reconfigure task, hence its name.

## ESP-IDF Hints viewer

ESP-IDF will try to show hints to resolve errors as described in [idf.py documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-py.html#hints-on-how-to-resolve-errors). It works with a database of hints stored in **tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml** and the hints will be printed if a match is found for the given error.

In the source code editor, errors that match a line will be shown when the user mouse is hovering that line.

The ESP-IDF bottom panel automatically updates to display ESP-IDF hints based on the errors in your currently opened file.

You can manually search for any ESP-IDF hint with the **ESP-IDF: Search Error Hint**. It will search from available hints listed in **$IDF_PATH/tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml**.
